  abstract = {There exist many definitions of the div and mod functions in
              computer science literature and programming languages. We briefly
              review the most common definitions (truncated division, Knuth's
              floored division, etc.) and discuss the rare, but mathematically
              elegant, Euclidean division. We also give an algorithm for the
              Euclidean div and mod functions and prove it correct with respect
              to Euclid's theorem.},
