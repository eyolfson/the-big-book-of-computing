\chapter{Mathematical Basics}

Understand the following terminology: commutativity, and associativity.

\section{Numeral Systems}

\subsection{Decimal}

The number system you're use to is base 10.

\subsection{Binary}

$4 = (100)_2$

\subsection{Octal}

This is the same as before, except now it's base 8.

\subsection{Hexadecimal}

Same as binary and octal, except instead of base 2 you use base 16.

\begin{tabular}{c c}
  \hline
  Value & Equivalent \\
  \hline
  10 & $(\text{A})_{16}$ \\
  11 & $(\text{B})_{16}$ \\
  12 & $(\text{C})_{16}$ \\
  13 & $(\text{D})_{16}$ \\
  14 & $(\text{E})_{16}$ \\
  15 & $(\text{F})_{16}$ \\
\end{tabular}

For instance: $95 = (5\text{F})_{16}$.
