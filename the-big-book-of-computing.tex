  \subsubsection{Amdahl's Law}

  Let $N$ be the number of parallel executions.

  \noindent Let $S$ be the fraction of serial runtime for a serial execution.

  \noindent Let $P$ be the fraction of parallel runtime for a serial execution.

  $\text{speedup} = \frac{1}{S + \frac{P}{N}}$

  \subsubsection{Gustafson's Law}

  Let $N$ be the number of parallel executions.

  \noindent Let $n$ be a measure of the problem size.

  \noindent Let $S(n)$ be the fraction of serial runtime for a parallel
  execution.

  \noindent Let $P(n)$ be the fraction of parallel runtime for a parallel
  execution.

  \vspace{1em}

  $\text{speedup} = S(n) + N \cdot P(n)$

  \section{Hamming Distance}

  A measure of how many characters are different in two strings of equal length.

  Example: Consider the two ASCII encoded strings ``this is a test'' and ``wokka
  wokka!!!''. Both have the same length of 14 characters. If each character is
  represented as 8 bits we have to many 112 comparsions ($14 \times 8$).

  \texttt{t} is $116 = (74)_{16} = (01110100)_{2}$

  \texttt{w} is $119 = (77)_{16} = (01110111)_{2}$

  This hamming distance between these two characters is 2.

  \texttt{h} is $104 = (68)_{16} = (01101000)_{2}$

  \texttt{o} is $111 = (6\text{F})_{16} = (01101111)_{2}$

  This hamming distance between these two characters is 3, running total of 5.

  \texttt{i} is $105 = (69)_{16} = (01101001)_{2}$

  \texttt{k} is $107 = (6\text{B})_{16} = (01101011)_{2}$

  This hamming distance between these two characters is 1, running total of 6.

  And so on, the hamming distance of these two strings is 37.
